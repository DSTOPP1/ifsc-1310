      <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
      <p>Working on my Segway project was a valuable learning experience, particularly after receiving feedback from my friend that the initial version didn’t feel modern enough. While I focused on the functionality of the project when I revisited the project and researched modern design principles such as minimalism and responsiveness. I focused on improving the visual elements, ensuring the design was more user-friendly and visually appealing, while also optimizing the performance to make the project feel more fluid and efficient. This process taught me how crucial design is not just for functionality, but for creating an engaging user experience that resonates with today’s standards.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on the project, I realize how much I’ve developed both my technical and design skills. Ultimately, this experience reinforced the importance of listening to feedback and continuously adapting. The revisions I made significantly improved the project, and the lessons I learned will undoubtedly influence my approach to future work, ensuring that both usability and aesthetic appeal are prioritized.</p>
      <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
      <p>Progressive enhancement is a web development strategy that prioritizes providing a functional, content-rich experience for all users, regardless of the device or browser they use. At its core, it emphasizes content first, ensuring that the most basic, semantic structure of a site is accessible to everyone. From there, additional layers of style (CSS) and interactivity (JavaScript) are progressively added based on the capabilities of the user's browser or device.</p>
      <p>The importance of progressive enhancement in modern web development lies in its focus on accessibility and universal usability. It ensures that even users with older or less capable devices can still access the essential content of a site, while those with modern, high-powered devices enjoy a richer, interactive experience. This is especially vital in an era where mobile and low-bandwidth users are increasingly common. It ensures that content remains the focal point.</p>
